\title{Scatterplot of TCR frequency between two samples}
\usage{
plot_sample_vs_sample(
  data1,
  data2,
  chain = c("beta", "alpha"),
  log2fc_cutoff = 3,
  sem_cutoff = 2.5,
  smooth_sem = c("window", "none"),
  window_size = 30,
  end_window_size = 5,
  pseudo1 = 1e-06,
  pseudo2 = 1e-06,
  labelx = "Frequency on timepoint 1",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{a list of three data frames (alpha, beta, and paired) for one sample}

\item{data2}{a list of three data frames (alpha, beta, and paired) for one sample}

\item{log2_cutoff}{the log2 fold-change cutoff to call a TCR up- or down-regulated (default 1.5)}
}
\value{
A scatterplot (ggplot object) with read frequencies (proportions), colored by whether each
TCR is up-regulated, down-regulated, or neither, given the log2 fold-change cutoff.
}
\description{
\code{plot_sample_vs_sample()} returns a scatterplot of read frequencies of TCRs between two samples
}
\details{
The function labels each TCR as up-regulated, down-regulated, or stable, based on the
log2 fold-change cutoff supplied (default 1.5).
