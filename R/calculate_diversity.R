#' Calculate TCR repertoire diversity metrics
#'
#' @description
#' \code{calculate_diversity()} returns a number of clonal diversity measures (e.g. Hill numbers,
#' Shannon and Simpson indices) calculated from supplied data.
#'
#' @details
#' This function calculates the following diversity indices:
#'
#' simpson - The Simpson diversity index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index).
#' This equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset represent the same type.
#' It is the inverse of the Hill number of order 2.
#'
#' gini - The Gini index/coefficient... (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).
#'
#' gini.simpson - The Gini-Simpson index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Gini%E2%80%93Simpson_index). Equal to 1-Simpson_index. This equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset represent different types.
#'
#' inv.simpson - The Inverse-Simpson index - i.e. the reciprocal of the Simpson index, which measures the effective
#' number of types when the weighted arithmetic mean is used to calculate diversity. It is equivalent to the
#' Hill number of order 2. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Inverse_Simpson_index)
#'
#' shannon - The Shannon diversity index, also known as the Shannon-Wiener index or Shannon entropy.
#' It is equivalent to the Renyi entropy when 'q' = 1.
#' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Shannon_index)
#'
#' berger.parker - The Berger-Parker index, i.e. the proportion of the most abundant type in the dataset. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Berger%E2%80%93Parker_index)
#'
#' richness - The species richness, i.e. the total number of unique types observed in the data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Richness).
#'
#' d50 - The minimum number of types (clones) needed to comprise 50 percent of the data.
#'
#' dXX - The minimum number of types (clones) needed to comprise XX percent of the data.
#'
#' renyi - The Renyi entropy, a generalization of Shannon diversity/entropy for values of 'q' other than 1.
#' The formula for Renyi entropy is undefined at q=1, but it is defined as its limit, which equals the Shannon entropy.
#' When q=0, it is simply the natural logarithm of the richness or total number of types.
#' When q=Inf, it is defined by its limit, which is equal to the negative of the natural logarithm
#' of the proportion of the most abundant type.
#' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#R%C3%A9nyi_entropy)
#'
#' hill - The Hill numbers of order q, also known as the true diversity or the effective number of types.
#' This is the number of equally abundant types needed for the average proportional abundance of types to equal
#' that observed in the dataset. The order 'q' defines the exponent used in the formula to define the
#' 'generalized mean' of the proportional abundances.
#'
#' q = 2 corresponds to the arithmetic mean (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean).
#'
#' q = 1 corresponds to the geometric mean (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean).
#'
#' and q = 0 corresponds to the harmonic mean (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean).
#'
#' When q = Inf, it is defined by its limit, which is the inverse of the proportion of the most abundant type.
#'
#' In general, as q increases, less weight is given to rarer species.

#'
#' @return returns a list with the requested indices. "simpson", "gini", "gini.simpson", "inv.simpson",
#' "shannon", "berger.parker", and "richness" return a vector of length one.
#'
#' "d50" and "dXX" return a data frame with the minimum number of clones needed to make up 50 (or XX) percent
#' of the data, the percentage (50 or XX) supplied, and the actual percentage of the data made up by those clones.
#' "dXX" may return a data frame with many rows if it is supplied a vector of percentages.
#'
#' "renyi" and "hill" return a data frame with the two columns, where each row contains the value for the Hill
#' (or Renyi) number of order 'q', and the other contains the value of the corresponding 'q'.
#' They return a data frame with many rows if supplied with a vector of orders (e.g. 1:5).
#'
#' @param data a TIRTLseqData object
#' @param chain the chain to use when calculating metrics, alpha or beta (default is "beta")
#' @param metrics the diversity indices or metrics to calculate.
#' @param samples the samples to calculate diversity metrics for (default is NULL, all samples)
#' @param q a vector of integers specifying which "orders" to calculate for Hill numbers and Renyi entropy.
#' @param percent a percentage (out of 100) or a vector of percentages to use when calculating dXX values,
#' i.e. the minimum number of clones needed to cover XX percent of the sample.
#' @param n the number of most frequent clones to use for the topNfraction metric.
